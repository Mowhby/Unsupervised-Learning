# Unsupervised Learning Project

## Key Concepts Learned:
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
  A dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a smaller number of components while preserving the maximum variance.

- **K-Means Clustering**  
  A clustering algorithm that partitions data into a specified number of clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster.
